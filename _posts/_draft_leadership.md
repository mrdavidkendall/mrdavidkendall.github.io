Managers do:
* define the processes to acheive the objective
* teach to the process
* make sure people are following the process

This is very effective for
jobs that don't require a ton of training
jobs where the output or solution is known
 repetitive tasks, 


Leaders do
* Set an objective
* Build a great team
* Help them
