Everyone could use a little help from time to time. Some of us need more help than others. Some need it more often than others. You don't always realize you need help. You don't always want it.

As I was recently reflecting on how I could be a better servant, and had an epiphany. I don't often get asked for help. I tell others "let me know if you need anything" and I almost always say yes when asked, but I can do better.

## don't expect people to ask for help

There are many reasons that poeple don't ask for help.

To many, asking for help is a sign of weakness. It can feel like you are admitting that you don't know something or can't figure it out. Without strong trust, the fear of being judged can be strong enough to deter asking.

People don't want to be a burden. In an increasingly busy world, time is precious. Asking for someone to spend their time helping you, especially when you think there time is more important than yours, can be tough.

Often, doing things on your own is a good way to learn. I like to do some things the hard way. The toil helps you remember. 

If you can't force people to ask, you must offer help over and over.  Do it publicly. Do it one on one. Make it normal. Make it feel wrong to refuse your offer. 

## A specific offer or choice is easier to accept

"If you need anything, just let me know"... How often have you said or hear this? It is almost always offered with good intentions, but typically doesn't result in a request.

Rather than offering generic help, I've found people are much more likely to accept help if the offer is specific. When you see your neighbor on crutches, asking "Is it okay if I mow your lawn when I'm done with mine?" will like get a different response than, "Let me know if you need anything."

Sometime specific isn't enough and you have to go farther.  "Which do you like better, pizza or chinese food?" can easily be followed up by "Should I drop some off around 6 or do you like to eat later?"

## don't expect people to know they need help

We are trained all our lives to be strong and independant.

## TLDR

It's our duty as leaders, friends, or family to help when called upon. It can be tough to say yes. It can feel like others take advantage of your generosity. 

Going forward, I strive to:
* ask more questions to understand obstacles
* offer help more often
* make offers for help more specific
