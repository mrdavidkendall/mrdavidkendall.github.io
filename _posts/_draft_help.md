don't expect people to ask for help.  it is a sign of weakness.

when kid was in the hospital, i needed help.  I was constantly asked, "If you need anything, just let me know"... "Let me know if there is anything I can do to help".  I never asked.  I couldn't.   

lucky i had a strong wife to lean on.

offer help.  
often.
make it specific.

give specific ways you can help. 
ideas to get started? ways to get unstuck? review? 

are you stuck? need advice?
