Everyone needs a little help from time to time. Some need it more often, some less. Sometimes, we don't even realize we need help—or we don't want to admit it.

Recently, as I reflected on how I could be a better servant, I had an epiphany: I don't often get asked for help. I tell others "let me know if you need anything" and I almost always say yes when asked, but I can do better.

## don't expect people to ask for help

There are many reasons that people don't ask for help.

To many, asking for help is a sign of weakness. It can feel like you are admitting that you don't know something or can't figure it out. Without strong trust, the fear of being judged can be strong enough to deter asking.

People don't want to be a burden. In an increasingly busy world, time is precious. Asking for someone to spend their time helping you, especially when you think their time is more important than yours, can be tough.

Often, doing things on your own is a good way to learn. I like to do some things the hard way. The toil helps you remember.

Since you can't force people to ask, you must offer help repeatedly—both publicly and privately. Normalize it. Make it feel natural to accept help, and unusual to refuse it.

## A specific offer or choice is easier to accept

"If you need anything, just let me know"... How often have you said or heard this? It is almost always offered with good intentions, but typically doesn't result in a request.

Rather than offering generic help, I've found people are much more likely to accept help if the offer is specific. When you see your neighbor on crutches, asking "Is it okay if I mow your lawn when I'm done with mine?" will likely get a different response than, "Let me know if you need anything."

Sometimes being specific isn't enough and you have to go farther.  "Which do you like better, pizza or Chinese food?" can easily be followed up by "Should I drop some off around 6 or do you like to eat later?"

## don't expect people to know they need help

Sometimes, people don't even realize they need help. They may be so used to managing on their own that it doesn't occur to them to accept assistance. 

They may know how to solve a problem, but not realize that they are struggling with it. They may be so focused on their own tasks that they don't see the bigger picture or the help available to them. There may be new tools or methods that could make their work easier, but they haven't had the time or opportunity to learn about them.

As someone who wants to help, it's important to be observant and proactive. Notice when someone is struggling, even if they don't say so.

## TLDR

As leaders, friends, or family, it's our duty to help when needed. Saying yes can be tough, and sometimes it feels like others take advantage of your generosity. But the rewards of helping are worth it.

Going forward, I strive to:
* Ask more questions to understand others' obstacles
* Offer help more frequently
* Make my offers of help specific and actionable
