I'm starting this site because I found that I had a lot of notes on life, software, politics and many other topics.  They were saved in many places and I wanted to consolidate them.  I also would like to build my writing skills and the best way to get better something is to do more of it.  I'll try to label posts here using categories to separate posts about me and posts about other topics.
